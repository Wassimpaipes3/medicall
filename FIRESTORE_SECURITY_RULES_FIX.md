# Firestore Security Rules Fix - Saved Locations

## The Error

```
[cloud_firestore/permission-denied] The caller does not have permission to execute the specified operation.
```

This error occurs when trying to save locations to `patients/{patientId}/savedLocations` because the Firestore security rules don't allow it.

## Solution: Update Firestore Security Rules

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Open Firebase Console**
   - Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/
   - Select your project: **medicall** (or your project name)

2. **Navigate to Firestore Rules**
   - Click **Firestore Database** in the left sidebar
   - Click the **Rules** tab at the top

3. **Update the Rules**

Replace your current rules with this:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    
    // ===== USERS COLLECTION =====
    match /users/{userId} {
      // Users can read and write their own user document
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      
      // Allow authenticated users to read other users' basic info (for chat, provider listings, etc.)
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // ===== PATIENTS COLLECTION =====
    match /patients/{patientId} {
      // Patients can read and write their own patient document
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == patientId;
      
      // IMPORTANT: Saved Locations subcollection
      match /savedLocations/{locationId} {
        // Patients can manage (read, write, update, delete) their own saved locations
        allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == patientId;
      }
    }
    
    // ===== PROFESSIONALS COLLECTION =====
    match /professionals/{professionalId} {
      // All authenticated users can read professional profiles (for booking)
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      
      // Only the professional can write to their own document
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == professionalId;
    }
    
    // ===== CHATS COLLECTION =====
    match /chats/{chatId} {
      // Users can read/write chats they are participants in
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
                           request.auth.uid in resource.data.participants;
      
      // Allow creating new chats
      allow create: if request.auth != null &&
                       request.auth.uid in request.resource.data.participants;
      
      // Messages subcollection
      match /messages/{messageId} {
        allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
      }
    }
    
    // ===== APPOINTMENTS/BOOKINGS COLLECTION =====
    match /appointments/{appointmentId} {
      // Users can read appointments where they are the patient or provider
      allow read: if request.auth != null && 
                     (request.auth.uid == resource.data.patientId ||
                      request.auth.uid == resource.data.providerId);
      
      // Users can create appointments as a patient
      allow create: if request.auth != null && 
                       request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.patientId;
      
      // Patients and providers can update their own appointments
      allow update: if request.auth != null &&
                       (request.auth.uid == resource.data.patientId ||
                        request.auth.uid == resource.data.providerId);
    }
    
    // ===== REQUESTS COLLECTION (for booking requests) =====
    match /requests/{requestId} {
      // Similar to appointments
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
      allow update: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

4. **Click "Publish"** button to save the rules

5. **Test Again**
   - Hot restart your app
   - Try saving a location
   - Should work now! ‚úÖ

## Quick Fix for Development Only

If you just want to test quickly (‚ö†Ô∏è **NOT for production**):

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

This allows any authenticated user to read/write anywhere. **Only use for testing!**

---

## Verify the Fix

### In Console:
After updating rules, you should see in your Flutter app console:

```
üíæ Saving location to Firebase: Home
   Patient ID: abc123...
   Collection: patients/abc123.../savedLocations
‚úÖ Location saved successfully
```

### In Firebase Console:
1. Go to Firestore Database ‚Üí Data tab
2. Navigate to: `patients` ‚Üí `{your-uid}` ‚Üí `savedLocations`
3. You should see your saved location documents

---

## What the Rules Do

### Key Rule for Saved Locations:
```javascript
match /patients/{patientId}/savedLocations/{locationId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == patientId;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- `request.auth != null` - User must be authenticated
- `request.auth.uid == patientId` - User can only access their own locations
- This prevents:
  - ‚ùå Unauthenticated users from accessing locations
  - ‚ùå Patient A from accessing Patient B's locations
  - ‚úÖ Allows each patient to manage only their own locations

---

## Testing After Fix

1. **Hot restart** the app
2. Go to booking flow ‚Üí Location selection
3. Try **"Use Current Location"** ‚Üí Tap **"Save This Location"**
4. Enter name: "Test Location"
5. Tap "Save"
6. Should see: ‚úÖ "Location saved successfully"
7. Check Firebase Console to verify

---

## Common Issues

### Issue 1: Still getting permission error
**Solution:** Make sure you clicked "Publish" in Firebase Console and wait 30 seconds for rules to propagate

### Issue 2: "not-found" error
**Solution:** Make sure the patient document exists in `patients/{uid}`

### Issue 3: Rules not working
**Solution:** 
1. Check that `request.auth != null` (user is logged in)
2. Check that `request.auth.uid` matches the patient ID
3. Try logging out and logging back in

---

## Security Best Practices

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Match user ID with document ID for personal data
- Use `request.auth.uid == patientId` for user-specific collections
- Test rules with Firebase Emulator

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Use `allow read, write: if true` in production
- Allow access to other users' data
- Forget to restrict subcollections

---

## Next Steps

After fixing the rules:
1. ‚úÖ Test saving current location
2. ‚úÖ Test saving custom location  
3. ‚úÖ Test loading saved locations
4. ‚úÖ Verify data in Firebase Console
5. ‚úÖ Test on different patient accounts

## Need Help?

If you still have issues:
1. Check Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore ‚Üí Rules tab
2. Look for syntax errors (red underlines)
3. Click "Simulate" to test rules
4. Check the Flutter console for detailed error messages

The updated code now shows:
- Better error messages
- Helpful instructions in console
- User-friendly notifications

**Date**: October 11, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Ready to fix - Update Firestore rules and test!
