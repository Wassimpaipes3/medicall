# 🚀 Quick Fix Reference Card

## What Was Fixed Today

### 1️⃣ Firestore Permission Error
**Problem**: `[cloud_firestore/permission-denied]` when marking notifications as read  
**Fix**: Updated `firestore.rules` to allow users to update their own notifications  
**Status**: ✅ Deployed to Firebase

### 2️⃣ Chat Navigation from Notifications  
**Problem**: "Professional not found" error when provider taps patient's message notification  
**Fix**: Smart role detection + appropriate chat screen routing  
**Status**: ✅ Implemented in code

## Expected Debug Output

## If Issues Persist

1. **Permission Error**: Check Firebase Console → Firestore → Rules (should show updated timestamp)
2. **Navigation Error**: Check user has `role` field in Firestore `users` collection
3. **Still Broken**: Review logs in `NOTIFICATION_CHAT_NAVIGATION_FIX.md`
