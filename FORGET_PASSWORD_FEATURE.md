# Forget Password Feature Implementation

## Overview
I've successfully implemented a complete Forget Password feature for your Flutter healthcare app with Firebase Auth integration.

## What was implemented:

### 1. AuthService Enhancement (lib/services/auth_service.dart)
- Added `sendPasswordResetEmail(String email)` method
- Comprehensive email validation (format and non-empty checks)
- Firebase Auth integration with `sendPasswordResetEmail`
- Detailed error handling for all possible Firebase Auth exceptions:
  - `user-not-found`: No account found with email
  - `invalid-email`: Email format validation
  - `too-many-requests`: Rate limiting protection
  - `network-request-failed`: Connection issues
- Returns structured response with success/error status and user-friendly messages in French

### 2. Forget Password Screen (lib/screens/auth/forget_password_screen.dart)
- Beautiful, animated UI matching your app's design language
- Animated background particles for visual appeal
- Email input field with real-time validation
- Loading state with circular progress indicator
- Success screen with clear instructions
- Error handling with user-friendly SnackBars
- "Try again" functionality for different email addresses
- Back to login navigation
- Responsive design with proper keyboard handling

### 3. Navigation Integration
- Added `forgetPassword` route to AppRoutes
- Updated login screen to navigate to forget password
- Integrated route in main.dart routing configuration

### 4. Theme Integration
- Added `borderColor` to AppTheme for consistent styling
- Uses existing color scheme and typography
- Maintains design consistency with rest of app

## Key Features:

✅ **Email Validation**: Both client-side and server-side validation
✅ **User-Friendly Messages**: All messages in French for your target audience  
✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for all scenarios
✅ **Security**: Uses Firebase Auth secure password reset functionality
✅ **UX**: Beautiful animations and clear user feedback
✅ **Responsive**: Works on different screen sizes
✅ **Accessible**: Clear instructions and visual feedback

## User Flow:

1. User clicks "Forgot Password?" on login screen
2. User enters their email address
3. App validates email format
4. If valid, Firebase sends reset email
5. User sees success message with instructions
6. User can try again with different email or return to login
7. User receives email and follows Firebase's secure reset process

## Error Scenarios Handled:

- Empty email field
- Invalid email format
- Email not registered in Firebase
- Network connectivity issues
- Rate limiting (too many requests)
- Unknown server errors

## Technical Implementation:

- **Firebase Auth**: `FirebaseAuth.instance.sendPasswordResetEmail()`
- **Validation**: Client-side regex + Firebase server validation
- **State Management**: StatefulWidget with proper loading states
- **Navigation**: Named routes with proper back navigation
- **Styling**: Consistent with existing app theme
- **Internationalization**: Ready for French localization

The feature is now fully integrated and ready for use. Users can reset their passwords securely through Firebase Auth's built-in password reset functionality.
