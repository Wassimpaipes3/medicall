---

## ✅ What Was Deployed

### 1. Security Rules ✅
**File:** `firestore.rules`

**Chat Rules Added:**
```javascript
// /chats: Real-time messaging system
- Users can only read chats they're participants in
- Users can only create chats where they're a participant
- Chat must have exactly 2 participants
- Users can update chats they're part of (for lastMessage)
- Users can delete their own chats

// /chats/{chatId}/messages: Individual messages
- Users can only read messages in chats they're part of
- Users can only send messages in chats they're part of
- Users can only create messages with their own senderId
- Users can update messages (for marking as seen)
- Users can delete messages in their chats
```

**Deployed to:** `nursinghomecare-1807f`  
**Status:** ✅ Active

### 2. Firestore Indexes ✅
**File:** `firestore.indexes.json`

**Indexes Created:**
1. **messages (Collection Group)**
   - Fields: `seen`, `senderId`, `timestamp`
   - Purpose: Query unread messages efficiently

2. **chats (Collection Group)**
   - Fields: `participants` (array), `lastTimestamp` (desc)
   - Purpose: Get user's chats ordered by most recent

**Status:** ✅ Building (may take 2-5 minutes to complete)

## 🧪 Test Your Chat System

Now that rules are deployed, test the integration:

### Test 1: Send a Message
```dart
// Run your app
flutter run

// Navigate to a chat screen
// Send a test message
// Expected: Message appears in Firebase Console
```

### Test 2: Verify in Firebase Console
1. Go to Firestore Database
2. Look for `chats` collection
3. Check if your test message appears
4. Verify structure matches:
```
chats/
  userId1_userId2/
    participants: [userId1, userId2]
    lastMessage: "test"
    lastTimestamp: Timestamp
    messages/
      messageId/
        senderId: "userId1"
        text: "test"
        timestamp: Timestamp
        seen: false
```

### Test 3: Real-Time Sync
1. Open app on Device 1
2. Open same chat on Device 2 (or web)
3. Send message from Device 1
4. Expected: Message appears instantly on Device 2
