### "No Scheduled Appointments" but I have appointments today
- Check appointment status = `"accepted"`, `"confirmed"`, or `"completed"`
- Verify appointment date is today
- Check `createdAt` or `updatedAt` field exists

### Navigation doesn't work
- Hot restart the app
- Verify routes are registered
- Check console for navigation errors
