## Technical Implementation

### New State Variables
```dart
bool _isSelectionMode = false;           // Track if in selection mode
Set<String> _selectedNotifications = {}; // Set of selected notification IDs
```

### Methods Added

#### Delete Methods
```dart
// Delete single notification
Future<void> _deleteNotification(String notificationId)

// Delete multiple selected notifications (batch)
Future<void> _deleteSelectedNotifications()

// Delete all notifications with confirmation
Future<void> _deleteAllNotifications()
```

#### Selection Methods
```dart
// Toggle selection mode on/off
void _toggleSelectionMode()

// Toggle individual notification selection
void _toggleNotificationSelection(String notificationId)
```

### UI Components

#### AppBar Actions (Dynamic)
```dart
// Normal Mode:
- "Mark All Read" button (if unread exist)
- Menu (⋮) with:
  - "Select Notifications"
  - "Delete All"

// Selection Mode:
- Delete icon (shows count)
- "Cancel" button
```

#### Notification Card (Enhanced)
```dart
// Features:
- Dismissible widget for swipe-to-delete
- Checkbox in selection mode
- Visual feedback when selected
- Long-press to enter selection mode
- Tap behavior changes based on mode
```

## Firestore Rules Update

### Before
```javascript
allow create, delete: if false; // Blocked all deletions
```

### After
```javascript
// Allow users to delete their own notifications
allow delete: if request.auth != null
  && resource.data.destinataire == request.auth.uid;

// Only Cloud Functions can create notifications
allow create: if false;
```

**Security**:
- ✅ Users can only delete their own notifications
- ✅ Must be authenticated
- ✅ Verified by `destinataire` field matching user UID
- ❌ Cannot delete other users' notifications
- ❌ Cannot create notifications (only Cloud Functions)
