# ðŸ§ª Complete Testing Guide - Appointment Request System

## Quick Start Testing (5 Minutes)

### 1. Create Test Request in Firestore

1. Open Firebase Console â†’ Firestore Database
2. Go to `appointment_requests` collection (create if doesn't exist)
3. Add document with Auto-ID:

```json
{
  "idpat": "test_patient_123",
  "patientName": "John Doe",
  "patientPhone": "+212600000000",
  "idpro": "YOUR_PROVIDER_UID_HERE",
  "service": "Home Visit",
  "prix": 200,
  "serviceFee": 20,
  "paymentMethod": "cash",
  "type": "scheduled",
  "appointmentDate": "October 17, 2025 at 2:30:00 PM UTC+1",
  "appointmentTime": "14:30",
  "patientAddress": "123 Main St, Casablanca",
  "notes": "Test appointment",
  "status": "pending",
  "etat": "en_attente",
  "createdAt": "[Use Firestore Timestamp - Now]",
  "updatedAt": "[Use Firestore Timestamp - Now]"
}
```

**IMPORTANT**: Replace `YOUR_PROVIDER_UID_HERE` with your actual provider's Firebase Auth UID.

### 2. Test in Provider Dashboard

2. Login as Provider
3. Go to Dashboard
4. **CHECK**: "Active Requests" section shows John Doe's request

2. Confirm in dialog

2. Click **"Decline"** button
3. Confirm in dialog

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: No Requests Appear

**Check**:
1. Is `idpro` field = your provider's UID?
2. Is `status` = "pending"?
3. Check Flutter logs: `flutter logs`
4. Check Firestore rules

**Solution**:
```dart
// Get your provider UID
print('Provider UID: ${FirebaseAuth.instance.currentUser?.uid}');
```

---

### Issue: Accept/Reject Doesn't Work

**Check**:
1. Internet connection
2. Firestore rules (see below)
3. Firebase Functions logs: `firebase functions:log`

**Firestore Rules Required**:
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /appointment_requests/{requestId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow delete: if request.auth != null;
    }
    match /appointments/{appointmentId} {
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

---

### Issue: Real-time Updates Don't Work

**Check**:
1. Are streams subscribed? (Check initState)
2. Check dispose() isn't canceling streams early
3. Restart app
