## 🚨 Important Notes

### After First Use:
Once you've cleaned up old documents, **remove the button**:

1. Open: `lib/screens/provider/provider_dashboard_screen.dart`

2. Find these lines (around line 349):
```dart
// 🔥 CLEANUP BUTTON - Remove after first use!
floatingActionButton: CleanupRequestsFAB(),
```

3. Delete or comment them out:
```dart
// floatingActionButton: CleanupRequestsFAB(),
```

4. Save and hot reload

### Why Remove It?
- You only need to clean **existing** old documents once
- New documents auto-delete after 10 minutes
- Keeping the button visible is unnecessary

---

## 🔍 Verify It Worked

### Before Cleanup:
1. Go to Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/nursinghomecare-1807f/firestore
2. Navigate to `provider_requests` collection
3. You'll see many documents

### After Cleanup:
1. Tap the cleanup button
2. Wait for success message
3. Refresh Firebase Console
4. Collection should be empty! ✅

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Button Not Showing?
- Make sure you're on the **Provider Dashboard** screen
- Try hot reload: Press `r` in terminal
- Or restart app: Press `R` in terminal

### Button Does Nothing?
Check console for errors:
- Look for `❌` messages
- Common issue: Firebase auth not working
- Solution: Make sure you're logged in as provider

### "Permission Denied" Error?
- Function requires authentication
- Log out and log back in
- Make sure provider account is active
