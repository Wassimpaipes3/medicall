# ✅ Auto-Delete Function - Verification Guide

## 🔍 Function Status

### **Current State:**
- ✅ Function deployed: `cleanupExpiredRequests`
- ✅ Schedule: Runs **every 5 minutes**
- ✅ Logic: Deletes documents where `expireAt <= now`
- ✅ Last run: Check logs below

---

## 📊 How It Works

```typescript
export const cleanupExpiredRequests = functions.pubsub
  .schedule("every 5 minutes")
  .onRun(async () => {
    const now = admin.firestore.Timestamp.now();
    
    // Find expired documents
    const expiredSnapshot = await db.collection("provider_requests")
      .where("expireAt", "<=", now)
      .get();
    
    // Delete them in batch
    const batch = db.batch();
    expiredSnapshot.docs.forEach((doc) => {
      batch.delete(doc.ref);
    });
    await batch.commit();
  });
```

## 🧪 How to Test

### **Method 1: Quick Test (2 Minutes)**

I created a test utility for you. Add this to your app:

```dart
// In main.dart, add route:
import 'package:firstv/screens/debug/test_auto_delete_screen.dart';

'/test-auto-delete': (context) => const TestAutoDeleteScreen(),
```

**Then:**
1. Navigate to the screen
2. Tap "Create Test Document (2 min)"
3. Document created with `expireAt` in 2 minutes
4. Wait 2-7 minutes
5. Document auto-deleted! ✅

---

### **Method 2: Manual Test**

Run this code anywhere in your app:

```dart
import 'package:firstv/utils/test_auto_delete.dart';

// Create test document
await testAutoDeleteFunction();

// Wait 2-7 minutes, then check:
await listAllRequestsWithExpiry();
```

---

### **Method 3: Real Booking Test (10 Minutes)**

1. Book a provider (normal flow)
2. Document created with 10-minute expiry
3. Wait 10-15 minutes
4. Check if document deleted

---

## 📝 Check Function Logs

### **Command:**
```powershell
firebase functions:log | Select-String "cleanupExpiredRequests" -Context 0,2
```

### **What to Look For:**

**Case 1: No expired documents**
```
🧹 No expired provider requests to clean up
```
✅ Normal - means no documents have expired yet

**Case 2: Documents deleted**
```
✅ Deleted 3 expired provider requests
```
✅ Working! Function found and deleted expired docs

**Case 3: Error**
```
❌ Error cleaning up expired requests: ...
```
❌ Problem - check the error message

## ⏰ Timeline Example

```
Time    | Action
--------|--------------------------------------------------
00:00   | Document created (expireAt = 00:10)
00:05   | Function runs → Not expired yet (00:05 < 00:10)
00:10   | Document expires (expireAt reached)
00:10   | Function runs → Finds expired doc → DELETES ✅
00:15   | Function runs → No expired docs
```

**Key Point:** Deletion happens in the **next function run after expiry**

---

## 🔍 Manual Verification

### **Check Current Documents:**

```dart
final snapshot = await FirebaseFirestore.instance
    .collection('provider_requests')
    .get();

for (var doc in snapshot.docs) {
  final data = doc.data();
  final expireAt = data['expireAt'] as Timestamp?;
  
  if (expireAt != null) {
    final expiresIn = expireAt.toDate().difference(DateTime.now());
    print('${doc.id}: expires in ${expiresIn.inMinutes} min');
  }
}
```

### **Check Specific Document:**

```dart
import 'package:firstv/utils/test_auto_delete.dart';

await checkDocumentExists('your-document-id');
```

---

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### **Normal Booking Flow:**
```
1. Patient books provider
   → Document created
   → expireAt = now + 10 minutes
   
2. Provider accepts (within 10 min)
   → status updated to 'accepted'
   → appointmentId added
   → Document still has expireAt
   
3. After 10 minutes
   → Function runs
   → Checks expireAt <= now
   → DELETES document ✅
   
4. Collection empty
   → Disappears from Firebase Console
   → Ready for new bookings
```

### **If Provider Doesn't Accept:**
```
1. Patient books provider
   → Document created
   
2. No response for 10 minutes
   → Document expires
   → Function deletes it ✅
   
3. Patient can book another provider
```

---

## 📊 Verify in Firebase Console

1. **Go to Console:**
   https://console.firebase.google.com/project/nursinghomecare-1807f/firestore

2. **Navigate to `provider_requests`**

3. **Check documents:**
   - Look at `expireAt` field
   - Compare to current time
   - Expired docs should disappear in next 5 min

4. **Refresh periodically**
   - Every 5 minutes
   - Watch expired docs vanish ✅

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **Documents Not Deleting?**

**Check 1: Does document have expireAt field?**
```dart
// Old documents (before update) don't have expireAt
// They won't be deleted automatically
```

**Check 2: Is expireAt actually in the past?**
```dart
final expireAt = data['expireAt'] as Timestamp;
final now = DateTime.now();
print('Expired? ${expireAt.toDate().isBefore(now)}');
```

**Check 3: Is function running?**
```bash
firebase functions:log
# Should see logs every 5 minutes
```

**Check 4: Any errors in logs?**
```bash
firebase functions:log | Select-String "Error"
```

## ✅ Verification Checklist

Test the system step by step:

- [ ] **Step 1:** Create test document (2 min expiry)
  ```dart
  await testAutoDeleteFunction();
  ```

- [ ] **Step 2:** Verify document exists
  ```bash
  # Check Firebase Console
  ```

- [ ] **Step 3:** Wait 2-7 minutes
  ```
  # Function runs every 5 min
  ```

- [ ] **Step 4:** Check if deleted
  ```dart
  await checkDocumentExists('doc-id');
  ```

- [ ] **Step 5:** Verify in logs
  ```bash
  firebase functions:log | Select-String "Deleted"
  ```

- [ ] **Step 6:** Test real booking (10 min)
  ```
  # Book provider, wait, verify deletion
  ```

## 📈 Performance Stats

**Current Settings:**
- Expiry Time: **10 minutes** (for real bookings)
- Function Frequency: **Every 5 minutes**
- Max Delay: **Expiry + 5 minutes**
- Example: Document expires at 14:30, deleted by 14:35 ✅

**Why 5 Minutes?**
- Balance between responsiveness and cost
- Most bookings are accepted within 5 minutes
- Firebase free tier includes 2M function calls/month (plenty!)
