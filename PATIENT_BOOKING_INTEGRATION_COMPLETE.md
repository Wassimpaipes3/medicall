## 📋 Changes Summary

### File Modified: `lib/screens/booking/polished_select_provider_screen.dart`

#### **1. Added Imports**
```dart
import 'package:firebase_auth/firebase_auth.dart';
import '../../services/appointment_request_service.dart' as AppointmentRequest;
```

#### **2. Updated `_selectProvider()` Method**
- Now shows a **dialog** when patient selects a provider
- Two options:
  - ⚡ **Instant** - Old flow (immediate booking)
  - 📅 **Schedule** - New flow (select date/time)

#### **3. Created Three New Methods**

##### `_createInstantRequest()`
- Handles the old instant booking flow
- Uses `ProviderRequestService.createRequest()`
- Navigates to waiting screen

##### `_createScheduledRequest()`
- Handles the new scheduled booking flow
- Calls `_showScheduleDateTimePicker()` to get date/time
- Fetches current user data from Firestore
- Calls `AppointmentRequestService.createAppointmentRequest()`
- Shows success message and navigates back

##### `_showScheduleDateTimePicker()`
- Beautiful Material 3 dialog with:
  - 📅 **Date Picker** - Select appointment date (up to 90 days ahead)
  - ⏰ **Time Picker** - Select appointment time
  - 📝 **Notes Field** - Optional special requests
  - ✅ **Confirm Button** - Validates selections
