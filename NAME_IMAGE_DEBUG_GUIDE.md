# 🔍 Provider Name & Image Debug Guide

## 🐛 Issues Reported

1. **Image not displaying** - Firebase Storage URL present but not showing
2. **Name showing as ID** - Provider name not appearing correctly

---

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Debug Logging
Added comprehensive logging to see exactly what's in your Firestore document:

```
📄 Full provider data:
   nom: Dr. Ahmed Benali (String)
   profilePicture: https://... (String)
   disponible: true (bool)
   service: consultation (String)
   ...
✅ Extracted Name: "Dr. Ahmed Benali"
✅ Extracted Image: "https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/..."
```

### 2. Better Image Error Handling
Now logs when image fails to load:

```
❌ Image load error for Dr. Ahmed: [error details]
   URL: https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/...
```

### 3. Additional Field Checks
Now also checks `profile_picture` (with underscore) for image URL.

## 🔍 Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Run the App
```powershell
flutter run
```

### Step 2: Navigate to Provider Selection
Complete the booking flow to see the provider cards.

### Step 3: Check Console Output

Look for this section:
```
📋 [PolishedSelectProvider] Processing 1 providers
   📄 Full provider data:
      [All your Firestore fields will be listed here]
   ✅ Extracted Name: "[YOUR PROVIDER NAME]"
   ✅ Extracted Image: "[YOUR IMAGE URL]"
```

### Step 4: Share the Output
Copy the entire console log section and share it so I can see:
- What fields exist in Firestore
- What values are being extracted
- Any image loading errors

## 🎯 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Name Showing as ID

**Symptoms:**
- Card shows document ID instead of name
- Shows: "7ftk4BqD7McN3Bjm3LFFtiJ6xkV2" instead of "Dr. Ahmed"

**Possible Causes:**
1. The `nom` field is empty or missing in Firestore
2. The name field has a different key (not `nom`, `name`, `login`, or `username`)

**Solution:**
Check the debug output to see what fields exist:
```
📄 Full provider data:
   userId: 7ftk4BqD7McN3Bjm3LFFtiJ6xkV2
   fullName: Dr. Ahmed Benali    ← Name is in "fullName" field!
```

If the name is in a different field, let me know and I'll add it to the fallback list.

### Issue 2: Image Not Displaying

**Your URL:**
```
https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/nursinghomecare-1807f.firebasestorage.app/o/profile_pictures%2Fprofile_7ftk4BqD7McN3Bjm3LFFtiJ6xkV2_1758994828327.jpg?alt=media&token=9ee65a9a-1783-4b09-9fa3-80c7e3931cd2
```

**Possible Issues:**

#### A. Field Name Mismatch
The image URL is stored in a field we're not checking.

**Currently checking:**
- `profilePicture`
- `photo`
- `image`
- `photoURL`
- `profile_picture`

**If your field is different:**
Check the debug output:
```
📄 Full provider data:
   avatar: https://... ← Image is in "avatar" field!
```

#### B. URL Format Issue
Firebase Storage URLs with `%2F` (encoded slashes) should work fine, but there might be a CORS issue.

**Test:**
- Open the URL directly in your browser
- If it downloads/shows the image → URL is valid
- If it gives an error → Permissions issue

#### C. Network/Cache Issue
CachedNetworkImage might be having issues loading the image.

**Solution:**
The debug output will show:
```
❌ Image load error for Dr. Ahmed: [specific error]
   URL: https://...
```

---

## 🔧 Quick Fixes to Try

### Fix 1: Verify Firestore Field Names

Go to Firebase Console → Firestore → `professionals` → Your provider document

**Check these fields:**

```
Name field (one of these):
✅ nom
✅ name
✅ login
✅ username
❓ [some other field]

Image field (one of these):
✅ profilePicture
✅ photo
✅ image
✅ photoURL
✅ profile_picture
❓ [some other field]
```

### Fix 2: Test Image URL

Copy your image URL and open it in a browser:
```
https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/nursinghomecare-1807f.firebasestorage.app/o/profile_pictures%2Fprofile_7ftk4BqD7McN3Bjm3LFFtiJ6xkV2_1758994828327.jpg?alt=media&token=9ee65a9a-1783-4b09-9fa3-80c7e3931cd2
```

**Expected:** Image downloads or displays  
**If it fails:** Firebase Storage permissions issue

### Fix 3: Check Firebase Storage Rules

In Firebase Console → Storage → Rules:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /profile_pictures/{imageId} {
      allow read: if true;  // Allow public read
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

2. **Copy the entire console output** starting from:
   ```
   📋 [PolishedSelectProvider] Processing 1 providers
   ```
3. **Share the output** so I can see:
   - What fields exist in your Firestore
   - What values are extracted
   - Any image loading errors

4. **Also share:**
   - What the card is currently showing (ID? name?)
   - Whether initials or blank image appears

## 💡 Temporary Workaround

If you want to see the provider immediately while debugging:

### Option 1: Update Firestore Field Names
Make sure your provider document has:
```json
{
  "nom": "Dr. Ahmed Benali",
  "profilePicture": "https://firebasestorage..."
}
```

### Option 2: Try Different Image URL
If Firebase Storage URL isn't working, try:
- A simple publicly accessible image URL (e.g., from Imgur, Cloudinary)
- Verify it's not a CORS or permissions issue

---

- ✅ All fields in your Firestore document
