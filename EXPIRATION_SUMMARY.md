## Status: **COMPLETE** ‚úÖ

---

## What Was Done

### Backend (Already Complete)
‚úÖ TTL system with `expireAt` field  
‚úÖ Cloud Function `cleanupExpiredRequests` (runs every 5 minutes)  
‚úÖ Firestore rules allow document creation and deletion  
‚úÖ Migration function to fix old documents without `expireAt`

### Frontend (Just Completed)
‚úÖ **modern_select_provider_screen.dart** - Updated waiting screen  
‚úÖ **polished_select_provider_screen.dart** - Updated waiting screen  
‚úÖ Real-time expiration detection (document deleted OR timestamp expired)  
‚úÖ Material 3 popup dialog with clear messaging  
‚úÖ "Try Again" button ‚Üí SelectProviderScreen  
‚úÖ "Cancel" button ‚Üí close dialog  

---

## Key Features

### 1. Automatic Detection
The waiting screen automatically detects when:
- Document is deleted by Cloud Function/TTL
- `expireAt` timestamp has passed

### 2. User-Friendly Dialog
```
‚è∞ Request Expired
Your request has expired. Please try again with another provider.

[Cancel]  [Try Again]
```

### 3. Smart Navigation
- **Try Again**: Returns to provider selection with same search params
- **Cancel**: Closes dialog, stays on screen

---

## Testing

### Quick Test:
1. Create a provider request
2. Wait for expiration (or manually delete in Firestore Console)
3. Dialog should appear automatically
4. Click "Try Again" ‚Üí should go back to provider selection

### Check Firestore:
- Go to Firebase Console
- Open `provider_requests` collection
- Verify documents have `expireAt` field
- Documents should auto-delete after 10 minutes

---

## Files Modified

1. `lib/screens/booking/modern_select_provider_screen.dart`
   - Converted to StatefulWidget
   - Added expiration checks
   - Added dialog handler

2. `lib/screens/booking/polished_select_provider_screen.dart`
   - Added expiration checks
   - Added dialog handler

---

## Next Steps (Optional)

### If you want to test immediately:
1. Create a test document with 1-minute expiry:
   ```dart
   expireAt: Timestamp.fromDate(DateTime.now().add(Duration(minutes: 1)))
   ```

2. Or manually delete a document in Firestore Console while patient is waiting

### If documents don't have expireAt:
Run the migration function:
```
https://us-central1-nursinghomecare-1807f.cloudfunctions.net/migrateProviderRequestsExpireAt
```
