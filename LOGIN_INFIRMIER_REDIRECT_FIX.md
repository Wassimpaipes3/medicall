# ✅ LOGIN REDIRECT FIX - INFIRMIER/NURSE NOW WORKING

## Problem Found During Analysis

While analyzing the login system, I discovered **another bug**:

**Issue**: Users with role "infirmier" or "nurse" were being redirected to the **patient dashboard** (`/home`) instead of the **provider dashboard** (`/provider-dashboard`)!

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

### Location: `lib/services/role_redirect_service.dart`

### getRedirectRoute() Function (BEFORE):

```dart
switch (role) {
  case 'patient':
    return '/home';
    
  case 'doctor':
  case 'docteur':
  case 'professional':
    return '/provider-dashboard';
    
  case 'admin':
    return '/admin-dashboard';
    
  default:
    debugPrint('Unknown role: $role, defaulting to patient');
    return '/home';  // ❌ Infirmier fell into default!
}
```

**Problem**: 
- "infirmier" and "nurse" were NOT in the switch cases
- They fell into the `default` case
- Default returns `/home` (patient dashboard)
- Result: Nurses logged in but got patient interface ❌

---

## ✅ Fix Applied

### Updated getRedirectRoute() (AFTER):

```dart
switch (role) {
  case 'patient':
    return '/home';
    
  case 'doctor':
  case 'docteur':
  case 'infirmier':   // ✅ ADDED!
  case 'nurse':       // ✅ ADDED!
  case 'professional':
    return '/provider-dashboard';
    
  case 'admin':
    return '/admin-dashboard';
    
  default:
    debugPrint('Unknown role: $role, defaulting to patient');
    return '/home';
}
```

## 🎯 Complete Role Mapping (AFTER FIX)

| Role | Redirect Route | Dashboard |
|------|----------------|-----------|
| `patient` | `/home` | Patient Home Screen |
| `docteur` | `/provider-dashboard` | Provider Dashboard ✅ |
| `doctor` | `/provider-dashboard` | Provider Dashboard ✅ |
| `infirmier` | `/provider-dashboard` | Provider Dashboard ✅ **FIXED!** |
| `nurse` | `/provider-dashboard` | Provider Dashboard ✅ **FIXED!** |
| `professional` | `/provider-dashboard` | Provider Dashboard ✅ |
