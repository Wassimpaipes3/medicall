## ⏱️ What's Happening Now

### ✅ Completed (Right Now):
1. Security rules deployed to Firebase ✅
2. Chat rules active and protecting your data ✅
3. Index deployment initiated ✅

### ⏳ In Progress (2-5 minutes):
1. Firebase is building indexes in the background
2. You can use the app now, but performance improves when indexes complete

### 🔍 Check Index Status:
**Visit:** [Firebase Console → Indexes](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/nursinghomecare-1807f/firestore/indexes)

**Look for:**
- `messages` index (seen, senderId, timestamp)
- `chats` index (participants, lastTimestamp)

**Status will show:**
- ⏳ "Building..." → Wait a bit longer
- ✅ "Enabled" → Fully ready!
